        <p class="page1">This assignment is based around a trip my older brother, <a href="page-six.html">Juan</a>, took me on over the summer.
Orignially he wanted to go away somewhere but wasn't sure on the location. I'd always ask jokingly
if I can tag along with him, however I wasn't prepared for his response. "You pick the spot and we go."
is what he said. I had thought he was kidding at first but he was serious. I was in shock when he told me 
that and I had no clue on where to choose. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to far away maybe a road trip, 
then part of me wanted wanted to go somewhere midwest, and another part of me was like "hey screw it, let's 
leave the country." I took about a week and gave it some serious thought. Narrowed it down to four locations:</p>
