        <p>Along our trip we pigged out on some amazing meals and snacks, these are just a few of the items we had.</p>
        <p><img src="images/food/denver-biscuit-co-1.JPG" alt="denver biscuit co"></p>
        <p>This was from a place called 'Denver Biscuit Company'. It's a piece of chicken with bacon between a biscuit and either: drenched in syrup, or served with a small cup of syrup on the side, for the non messy people. Below is a boomerang clip from Instagram I took of it.</p>

        <p>Next we visited 'Voodoo Doughnuts'. A place that has pretty much any kind of douhgnut you can think of. You name it, they've probably put it together somehow.</p>

        <p>This is also a boomerang I took of the box of doughnuts we had picked out.</p>

            <p>From cereal, to crushed up cookies to thick glazing, these are the best doughnuts I've ever had.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This next snack was from one of those ice cream roller vendors on a main street.</p>

        <p>Now aside from the snacks we have this amazing Mexican restaurant we went to.</p>

        <p>We also went to 'Great Divide'. A local brewery that makes their own beer.
